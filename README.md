# what is alitomate?
Fire is one of the disasters that often occur in urban areas. According to statistical data on fire and rescue events in DKI Jakarta in 2020, there were 5043 fire and rescue cases. There are various causes of fires. Most often we report fire incidents by phone call and that takes time. How can technology help to minimize time spent for reporting cases? We chose to try to solve this problem by creating an “AlitõMate” app. “AlitõMate” can help identify fires and reporting along with location of the incident, then the app can provide a map view with incident interest points to help authorities determine the location of the incident. Machine learning implemented on the app is used for identifying fire in an image and filtering it accordingly to prevent false reports. While GPS is used for the responder to find the report location easier and get to the location faster. We also provide an emergency call button in case there is an obstruction resulting in the user cannot submit a report
